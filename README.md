# Hi there, I am Natalia 🙋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a  *Technical SEO Specialist* currently working at Virgin Media O2, where I optimise websites for organic performance, searchability and user experience. 

 ## A bit about me: 

I have always been passionate about how websites are built and function. In June last year, I completed **CFG Front End Development** course. It has inspired me to build my own website and help friends and family with their SEO and website projects. 
I'm very excited to be given this opportunity to participate in the Product Management CFG Degree. I hope to combine my technical experience with the new skills I'll learn throughout this training and explore Product as a new career path. 

 ## When I'm not building websites or making them rank in organic search...
 
- I take long walks by the river 🌊
- Travel to discover new places ✈️
- Experiment in the kitchen with cooking 🥘
- Read and listen to podcasts about self-development 📚
- Meet new people  😊

Second part of week 1 assigment 

1.  <mark> .gitignore</mark> is a file in my repo that tells Git and GitHub to be ignored when making a commit. In my case, it's Python file
2.  <mark> requirements.txt </mark> has been created - this is a list of all product dependencies and requirements outlining what technologies/libraries. It's helpful when it comes to collaboration and deployment, ensuring consistency across various setups.
