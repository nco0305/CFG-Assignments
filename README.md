# Hi there, I am Natalia 🙋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a  *Technical SEO Specialist* currently working at Virgin Media O2, where I optimise websites for organic performance, searchability and user experience. 

 ## A bit about me: 

I have always been passionate about how websites are built and function. In June last year, I completed **CFG Front End Development** course. It has inspired me to build my own website and help friends and family with their SEO and website projects. 
I'm very excited to be given this opportunity to participate in the Product Management CFG Degree. I hope to combine my technical experience with the new skills I'll learn throughout this training and explore Product as a new career path. 

 ## When I'm not building websites or making them rank in organic search...
 
- Taking long walks by the river 🌊
- Travelling to discover new places ✈️
- Experimenting in the kitchen with cooking 🥘
- Reading and listening podcasts about self-development 📚
- Meeting new people  😊
